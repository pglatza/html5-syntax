syntax.whatwg.org directory plan

This document lays out the plan for present and future syntax definitions,
given as a URI hierarchy. All files for a given syntax definition are in
one directory. This means a lot of duplication of things like the entity
definitions, but it will help with revision-tracking and packaging.

The general plan is as follows:
  - the first-level directory specifies the format
  - the second-level directory gives the language/combination
    (language version increments are reflected at this level;
     not sure yet exactly how)
  - each directory must have a README detailing what it is
    combination syntax files must state the equivalent versions of
    all stand-alone components

The maintainer of this system is fantasai <http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/contact>.
